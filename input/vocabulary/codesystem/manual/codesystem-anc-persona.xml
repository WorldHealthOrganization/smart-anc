    <description value="A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or “end-user”, of the system. Although the specific roles and demographic profile of the personas
will vary depending on the setting, the generic personas are based on the WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.
Please note that these are developed based on synthesis across multiple contexts as a starting point, and further contextualization will be required
according to the needs, motivations and challenges of the targeted personas in each setting."/>

			<definition value="Pregnant women are the primary clients receiving antenatal care (ANC) services from the targeted health
worker personas. While this is a diverse population group with different demographics, psychological and
social needs, they generally have the following expectations from ANC programmes:
» maintaining a healthy pregnancy for mother and baby (including preventing and treating risks, illness and
death);
» having an effective transition to positive labour and birth;
» maintaining physical and sociocultural normality;
» achieving positive motherhood (including maternal self-esteem, competence, autonomy) (12,24).
Specific considerations in health service delivery will need to be incorporated for pregnant women and girls
from certain population groups, including, but not limited to: adolescent girls and young women, women
and girls living with HIV, and women and girls with poor access to health-care facilities.
The content specifications for pregnant women will become even more important as additional client-side
digital functionalities (e.g. on-demand information services, targeted client communication [reminders],
reporting of health system feedback by clients on the quality of care, personal health tracking) are
incorporated."/>

an auxiliary nurse, an auxiliary nurse midwife has basic nursing skills but no training in nursing decisionmaking.
They possess some competencies in midwifery but are not fully qualified as midwives."/>
